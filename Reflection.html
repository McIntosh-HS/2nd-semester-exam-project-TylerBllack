        <p> Overall, I had a positive experience with taking this class. We delved into coding and web-development very deeply, which I enjoyed thoroughly. It was definetly one of the more fun classes that I took this year, and I would reccommend it. Some specific topics I enjoyed this year were:</p>
        <p> Firstly was those "logic tables." Using Minecraft education edition, and the redstone in tit, was definetly a unique experience through every class that I have ever taken, and the familiarity of using a game that I am used to helped me to better grasp the concept and have fun with it.</p>
        <p> Secondly was learning HTML. It was actually a lot simpler that I had expected, and the sort of relief of seeing how easy it was put me at ease, and allowd me to have fun with it.</p>
        <p> The last topic I enjoyed was learning the computer parts. I had always been a fan of computers and how they are built, so being able to open and take apart a compter was fun. I also learned a lot more about computers than what I thought I knew originally, which only added to my love of these machines.</p>
